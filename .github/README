This library allows to read GROMACS trr and xtc files and also to convert from one format to another.

The library itself is offered under the BSD license, which means you are free to incorporate it any way you want in other libraries or executables, no matter what the final license is.

========================

The original xdrfile library reads in double-precision trr file as floating-precision data.

This modified library enables the ability that lets user reads the trr as double-precision.

Use `make double` to compile the trr-related library in complete double precision. Note that the xtc-related functions will always be in single precision.
